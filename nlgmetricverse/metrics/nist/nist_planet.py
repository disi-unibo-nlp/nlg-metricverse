_DESCRIPTION = """
NIST is a method for evaluating the quality of text which has been translated using machine translation. Its name comes 
from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. The NIST metric was designed to improve BLEU by rewarding
the translation of infrequently used words. It is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations. 
Where BLEU simply calculates n-gram precision adding equal weight to each one, NIST also calculates how informative a 
particular n-gram is. That is to say when a correct n-gram is found, the rarer that n-gram is, the more weight it will 
be given. For example, if the bigram "on the" is correctly matched, it will receive lower weight than the correct 
matching of bigram "interesting calculations", as this is less likely to occur. The final NIST score is calculated
using the arithmetic mean of the ngram matches between candidate and reference translations. In addition, a smaller
brevity penalty is used for smaller variations in phrase lengths. NIST also differs from BLEU in its calculation of the
brevity penalty insofar as small variations in translation length do not impact the overall score as much. The
reliability and quality of the NIST metric has been shown to be superior to the BLEU metric in many cases.
The metric can be thought of as a variant of BLEU which weighs each matched n-gram based on its information gain,
calculated as:
$Info(n-gram) = Info(w_1,\dots,w_n) = log_2 \frac{# of occurences of w_1,\dots,w_{n-1}}{# of occurences of w_1,\dots,w_n}$
To sum up, the idea is to give more credit if a matched n-gram is rare and less credit if a matched n-gram is common.
This also reduces the chance of gaming the metric by producing trivial n-grams.
