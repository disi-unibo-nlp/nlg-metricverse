# Metric card for Abstractness

# Metric description
The Abstractness metric measures how many new n-grams are present in the hypothesis compared to the references.

A decrease in the abstractness of the sentence evaluated with respect to its reference was found by [recent studies](https://github.com/esdurmus/feqa): as the number of nodes in input to the model increases, the generated hypothesis becomes less and less abstract.
